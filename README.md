# MoreImmutableCollections
An implementation of FastImmutableDictionary and FastImmutableHasSet.

This is based on the discussion at https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/33671

This code was implemented very quickly, as I needed it for a project I was using. 
As such I only tested the functionality I was actually intending to use! 

**Use at your own risk!**
